# Digital Dojo Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)


<details>
  <summary><h2>Who can attend the Dojo?</h2></summary>
  
  The service is currently only available to teams that work in Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC), a department of the Government of Canada.
    
</details>

<details>
  <summary><h2>Does this service cost anything?</h2></summary>
  
  No. Our coaches , facilitators and Dojo staff salaries are all covered under our service's budget, as it helps the department meet its modernization goals.
  The only investment you need to consider is your team's time spent in the Dojo.
    
</details>

<details>
  <summary><h2>I can't pause my ongoing work. Should I still be considering the Dojo?</h2></summary>
  
  You will not need to completely pause your ongoing deliverables while in the Dojo. It's true that time will be spent on learning and readjusting how you work as a team, but you will come into the Dojo with work to complete as you practice new ways of working.
    
    Teams that feel they are too busy to include continuous improvement in their cycles are actually a good fit for the Dojo! It tells us that we could help with prioritizing, organizing work, reducing dependencies and achieving a sustainable work pace through focus.  
    
    We have found that teams that invest some time to improve how they work are able to be more efficient moving forward. A good investment!
    
</details>

<details>
  <summary><h2>What experts do you have in your team?</h2></summary>
  
  Our team of coaches and Dojo staff are full time employees of the public service. Most of us have 10+ years in development and applying agile best practices in a government context. 
    
    We are also very lucky to have a full time UI/UX resource on the team, a technical advisor very familiar with the IT processes in the department, and apprentices that bring new ideas to the table. 
    
    We recognize that we are not experts in all subject matters and technologies, which is why our staffing strategy includes partnerships, micro-missions and seeking out experts in other branches/departments/government levels.
    
    We will be honest with you about what we feel comfortable coaching ourselves, and when we feel we need to bring in outside help.
